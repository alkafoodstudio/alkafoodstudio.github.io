        <h1>Bhindi (Okra) Stir-fry</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul><li>250g Bhindi (Okra), cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
<li>1 tbsp oil</li>
<li>A pinch of Hing (Asafoetida)</li>
<li>½ tsp Ajwain (Carom seeds)</li>
<li>½ tsp Red Chili Powder</li>
<li>½ tsp Salt (adjust to taste)</li>
<li>1 tsp Dhaniya Powder (Coriander powder)</li>
<li>¼ tsp Garam Masala (add at the end)</li>
<li>½ tsp Amchur (Dry Mango Powder, to avoid stickiness)</li></ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ul><li>Wash and dry the Bhindi thoroughly. Cut them into 1-inch pieces, removing the ends. Dry the Bhindi completely with a towel to avoid sliminess while cooking.</li>
<li>In a pan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add a pinch of Hing and ½ teaspoon of Ajwain. Let them sizzle for a few seconds.</li>
<li>Add ½ teaspoon of Red Chili Powder and stir quickly to avoid burning the spices.</li>
<li>Add the cut Bhindi to the pan and sauté on medium-high heat. Stir the Bhindi occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the pan.</li>
<li>After a few minutes, add ½ teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of Dhaniya powder. Stir well, ensuring the Bhindi is evenly coated with the spices.</li>
<li>Add ½ teaspoon of Amchur powder to reduce any sliminess. Stir and cook the Bhindi for another 5-7 minutes until it becomes soft and slightly crisp.</li>
<li>Once the Bhindi is cooked, sprinkle ¼ teaspoon of Garam Masala and stir it.</li></ul>
